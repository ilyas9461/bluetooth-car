<h1 align="center">Bluetooth Controlled Arduino Car </h1>


## Intorduction

Bluetooth-controlled car study made with Arduino UNO. The mechanical parts of the car are made of forex material. Forex material was preferred because it is easy to process by hand. It can be easily shaped with the help of a utility knife.


## How is it working?

It can be easily operated with the help of a Bluetooth control program downloaded to your mobile phone from Google Play. We used the Bluetooth RC Controller program. Obstacles can be detected with two distance sensors at the front and back. The ultrasonic sensor on the front can scan an angle of 120 degrees with the servo motor. When there is an obstacle to the front or back the car stops automatically. We used the L298 module as the motor driver circuit. Commands sent via the mobile phone are sent serially to the UNO via the Bluetooth module. The car makes appropriate movements according to the defined commands.

Necessary definitions and explanations have been made on the software. You can review the software for more detailed information.
